- Getting it running

1. make sure cabal-install is up to date

> cabal update
> cabal install cabal-install

2. make sure newest version of cabal is on your path

Adding ~/.cabal/bin to your $PATH should make this work

> cabal --version

should be

> > cabal-install version 1.20.0.3
> > using version 1.20.0.2 of the Cabal library

3. set up a sandbox

From inside the mpi-coursework directory

> cabal sandbox init
> cabal sandbox add-source mpi/ haskell-mpi/ matrix/

4. install necessary packages

(If this fails to compile, make sure that the include dir and lib dir is correct - these values work on DEC-10 machines)

> cabal install mpi matrix haskell-mpi -fmpich14 --extra-lib-dirs=/usr/lib64/mpich2/lib/ --extra-include-dirs=/usr/include/mpich2-x86_64/

5. boot mpd and run

> mpd &

switch this for whatever command should be used for booting mpd

> LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/mpich2/lib/ mpirun -np 4 .cabal-sandbox/bin/mpi

switch the -np argument with however many processes to run it on
